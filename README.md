🧠 Machine Learning Models

The system trains and evaluates five different models:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model is assessed based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC AUC, allowing selection of the most reliable model for predictions.
